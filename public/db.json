    "description": "Biryani is one of Bangladeshi people’s most loved foods. It is so loved, it is served at most festivals and special occasions, such as weddings, picnics, etc. I love this dish.n/a The most popular biryani in Bangladesh is Dhaka Kacchi Biryani. You will always find the Dhaka street biryani stall crowded because of the huge demand for this food. The main ingredients are rice and marinated meat cooked in lots of spices, giving it its special taste. The spices are nutmeg, mace, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onion, tomatoes, green chilies, and garlic. It is sometimes served with a boiled egg and salad.This rich and flavorful dish is lip-smackingly good. A tip: take a half spoon of biryani and put it on your tongue without chewing it. You will feel the flavor spreading around your mouth. Everyone is happy with a plate of biryani, so you too should try this little bit of magic.",

There are different ways of grilling chicken and there are many variations of spices that are used. Many restaurants roast chickens in a glass oven placed outside to entice people in to eat. It’s a very successful strategy.Now, it is mostly eaten with Naan Roti. Naan Roti is an oven-baked leavened flatbread—the perfect food with chicken. The bread is a little sweet while the chicken is spicy. This combination creates a fabulous wild taste in your mouth.",
